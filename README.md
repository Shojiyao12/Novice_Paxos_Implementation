# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Simulator

This project simulates the **Paxos Consensus Algorithm**, enabling distributed processes to agree on a single value even in the presence of node failures and unreliable communication. The implementation follows Leslie Lamport's "Paxos Made Simple" paper and provides a configurable environment for testing and understanding the protocol.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üìñ Usage

### Running the Simulation
Run the simulation with default parameters:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Generating a New Configuration
Generate a default configuration file with custom node counts:
```bash
python main.py --generate-config --num-proposers 3 --num-acceptors 5 --num-learners 2
```

### Running with Custom Parameters
Customize the simulation with additional options:
```bash
python main.py --config custom_config.json --message-loss 0.1 --min-delay 0.05 --max-delay 0.2 --failure-prob 0.1
```

## üìú Paxos Protocol Implementation

The Paxos algorithm is implemented in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1a (Prepare)**: 
   - A proposer selects a proposal number and sends a `PREPARE` request to a majority of acceptors.

2. **Phase 1b (Promise)**:
   - Acceptors respond with a `PROMISE` if the proposal number is higher than any they have seen.
   - They include the highest-numbered proposal they have already accepted (if any).

3. **Phase 2a (Accept)**:
   - The proposer sends an `ACCEPT` request to the acceptors with the chosen value.

4. **Phase 2b (Learn)**:
   - Acceptors notify learners of the accepted value.
   - Learners determine the consensus value once a majority of acceptors agree.

## üß™ Simulation Features

- **Multiple Roles**: Simulates proposers, acceptors, and learners.
- **Network Simulation**: Configurable message delays and losses.
- **Failure Handling**: Simulates node failures and recoveries.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for debugging and analysis.
- **Consensus Verification**: Ensures Paxos safety properties:
  - **Agreement**: All learners agree on the same value.
  - **Validity**: The chosen value is proposed by a proposer.
  - **Integrity**: A value is chosen at most once.

## üìä Example Output

### Logs
The simulation logs all protocol messages and events. Example:
```log
2025-04-21 14:42:17,798 - root - INFO - Proposed operation 'test_operation_1745217737' with timestamp 3000001
2025-04-21 14:42:17,815 - root - INFO - CONSENSUS REACHED: Operation 'test_operation_1745217737' has been chosen!
```

### Consensus Verification
- Learners log the chosen operation once consensus is reached.
- Example:
  ```log
  2025-04-21 14:42:17,815 - Learner_learner_1 - INFO - Operation test_operation_1745217737 has been chosen
  ```

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Verify Correctness

1. **Consensus**: Ensure all learners agree on the same value.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Verify consensus is reached despite simulated failures.
3. **Safety Properties**: Check that agreement, validity, and integrity are maintained.
